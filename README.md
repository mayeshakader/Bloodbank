## Project Overview
The **Blood Bank Management System** is a real-time, location-based platform designed to efficiently connect blood donors with recipients.

- **User Registration & Authentication**: Secure sign-up and login for donors, recipients, and administrators.
- **Location-Based Search**: Interactive maps displaying donor locations with real-time GPS tracking.
- **Request Management**: Recipients can create blood requests specifying type, urgency, and location.
- **In-App Communication**: Secure messaging and call integration between donors and recipients.
- **Donation History Tracking**: Keeps records of past donations and eligibility periods.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Platform management, user verification, and data security controls.

## Technologies Used
